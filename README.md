# Rosette

## Update 1
Based on the discussions during lecture and the concepts that have been talked about,
there is a lot of material that went over our heads but we still think that there
is a lot we can do to learn something new. We're going to start by downloading racket
and learning how to use it, writing some programs to help us understand how
the language works. Then we'll go from there and move onto Rosetta.

* Used [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bq25PHiRVfM) for an intro to Racket tutorial. Ended up being a great first video and introduction to the basics of Racket
* Played with the examples given in the video and then moved on to solving some commonly asked "Leetcode Easy" coding problems
* Trying to solve these problems ended up being a really helpful thing to do because it exposed many of the differences between program "structures" used by C-like languages

## Update 2
Have the hang of using Racket. Downloaded Rosette. Took a while to understand the
implementation for classify.rkt. We think it's correct...might come back to it...
